# Travel Information App Project

## Overview

This is the Capstone project for my Udacity Front-end Nanodegree course.

## Instructions

### Project configuration

In order to run this project, you'll need to create a `.env` file at the root directory of the project, containing the follwing environment variables:

- `WEATHERBIT_API_KEY`
- `WEATHERBIT_URL`
- `PIXABAY_API_KEY`
- `PIXABAY_URL`
- `GEONAMES_URL`
- `GEONAMES_KEY`

### Running the project

1. Execute `npm run install` to install all the dependencies
2. Execute `npm run build-prod` to compile the project using Webpack
3. Execute `npm run start` to run the API which statically serves the front-end app.

## Extras

As an extra-mile, I included the Weather icon. It would only appear in case the trip is in at most until 16 days away.
